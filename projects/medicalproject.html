            <h1 class="margin text-center">Medical Project</h1>
            <h2> Context </h2>
            <p> In this project, I used various Javascript elements including objects, arrays, conditionals, etc. alongside my tool, Babylon, to combine and create a functioning medical simulation. My partner and I recycled out initial goal of creating medical prototypes which aim to improve the healthcare industry and look ahead of existing medical technology. </p>
            <h2> Content </h2>
            <p> With what we acquired in class, my partner and I were able to form a freedom project related to medicine. The foundation of our project lies on Javascript elements which primarily consisted of arrays, functions, loops, and conditionals. Through these elements we were able to create an interactive pointer (conditionals), labels (functions), a range of colors and textures (arrays), and the blood analyzing model itself (a combination of all three of these factors). To correspond with our model, we also incorporated a website to briefly explain our goal and context of the model. We edited our website mainly through CSS and HTML elements, CSS for color and organization and HTML for the content and general text overlay. </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> Challenges: Being that the project was a collaboratuve effort in comparison to my last year's freedom project where I worked solo, I encountered many communicative issues this year. Whether it was faulty wifi or simple miscommunication, it was always a fault in our mutual skill which resulted in our project getting delayed. To solve this, it was crucial we knew where the other party was at being that we had to tie in all our progress to our initial goal. We needed to remind ourselves why we specifically selected each other to work towards this goal. To do this, we were made to recollect and learn the information each of us possessed and exchange. By working on this exchange of information, we were able to effectively connect the different parts of our project instead of leaving it unorganized and disconnected. Learning to better communicate with my partner led me to better communicate in life outside of SEP where I'm now better relaying information to my family relating to school and other priorties. Better communication with my family helped ground my relationships and schedule. To put it simply, I feel a lot more organized as a person with my priortiies set straight.  </p>
            <p> Takeaways: Alongside communication stuggles, I also experienced the struggle of being lost on numerous sections of the project, particularly the conversion between code learned in class to code relating to my Babylon tool. I was eventually forced to better research my tool and scroll through various demos to combine Babylon specific manners, link the connection to the code we learned in class(i.e P5Js) and incorporate that combined code into my model. Studying these subjects to a greater extent helped me idenitfy my tool as a whole and portray it in different ways for different parts of my project. Better research and communication skills collectively led to identifying and relaying my identity and life goals with my family and friends, as far fetched as it may seem. </p>
            <p> Next steps: I wish to continue reflecting on these skills and struggles as I haven't perfectly adopted them. I still have many projects awaiting me in the future and to overcome these upcoming projects, the skills of communication and research will greatly affect my progress during those projects which is why it's important to continue improving on these skills for the upmost result. </p>
