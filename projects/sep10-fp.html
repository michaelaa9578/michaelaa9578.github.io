            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <h2> Context </h2>
            <p> In this project, I used collected research and components of code to create a website on a topic I found interesting. Minimal viable products required certain code components, well-constructed content, practicality, originality, and incorporating a LOYO tool (in my case,) it was Aframe: a 3D modeling tool). It was my ultimate goal to complete these MVP requirements. </p>
            <h2> Content </h2>
            <p> With what I have acquired in class for the past year, I put together a functioning website on medicine. Overall, the process was difficult but worth it in the end. I was able to improve on several skills throughout the year working on mini projects leading up to this final project. These skills included time management, collaboration, listening, scheduling, and more. By learning real-life skills, I was also able to learn more factors related to coding. I was able to test out numerous Bootstrap components and tinker with my Aframe tool. Using these parts of the project alone was able to help me brainstorm more ideas for and outside of medicine. </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> Challenges: My biggest challenge throughout this project was brainstorming. Although I had previously planned out ideas to include in my project, when it came to executing them, I ran into logical issues in terms of both code and content. This led to me having to change these ideas and create completely different ones in a way that supported the flow of my project. I was able to overcome this, however, it took away a large portion of my time which I could have spent on improving other areas of my project. This led me to my next issue of focusing too much on the small details of my project rather than supporting the big idea. I would either spend too much time on the images or the placement of certain bootstrap components to the point where the purpose/topic of my project became unclear. I started using a similar pattern for most of the factors of my project as well as spending an equal amount of time on each part to keep the main idea relevant.</p>
            <p> Takeaways: I used help around me for most of the struggles I was experiencing. I would continuously ask questions and take mental notes when I saw the projects of my peers. Communication was a significant step in completing my project. I also used past classwork material to review topics that I forgot that I wanted to put into my project. By revisiting my past work, I was able to ingrain information into my knowledge including certain codes, content, and reflective stances. Overall, I was able to self-reflect and find out what works for me when it comes to creating projects like these. </p>
            <p> Next steps: I plan to continue brainstorming the devices that I have included in my project while also improving other skills in future projects. </p>
